            <p class="lead">
                An amazing game that I recenetly revisted and had an amazing time with. Considering how old the game is the graphics still looked good. 
                The gameplay is intuitive and all the characters feel like they play different, even the color copies. 
                The special hits/pitches have been revisted from the previous game. Only wish would be a more robust story mode that serves more purpose
                than mainly a storymode

                I am a huge pokemon fan now, but when this game came out I had new played a pokemon game before. This game was truly amazing 
                It introduced new battle types, it made online battling/trading so much easier, introduced a new pokedex and forced everyone to choose pokemon exclusive to the region, and most importantly
                <mark>This game easily has the best story of any pokemon game!</mark> This region was also the first not based off a region Japan

                A game I have played, many many times. With cheat codes, without cheatcodes, A game that's just really fun to play. 
                Finding multiple combinations of characters to play with never gets tiring. This game introduced me to so many different characters and teams in the marvel universe.

                This is easily my favorite game ever. The fact that every character that has been in an iteration of Super Smash Bros is in the game is amazing. The 
                roster is absolutely huge and <em>almost</em> everyone is super fun to play. A Game I have spent literally 1000+ hours playing and that number shall only continue to grow.
